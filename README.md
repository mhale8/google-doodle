# Google Doodle

##Chosen Theme: Moana
The point of the is Google Doodle is to Celebrate the disney movie Moana becasue it has reached the top 5 movies for this year. The letter 'G' and 'l' will be the Moana typeface. Both 'oo' will be the island and the animation will be beating--- the island is considered to be alive in the movie. The 'g' will the stone heart/boat sail symbol, but in this case will resemble the sun. Laslty the letter 'e' will be the body wave that helped Moana on her journey.
